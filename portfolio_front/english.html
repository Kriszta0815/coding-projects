<p> My name is Krisztina Horvath-Schwarcz, I am a proud student at <a href="https://everyonecodes.io/"> everyone codes

</a> and will soon be finished with my <strong>Java Software Developer</strong> training.
</p>
<p>I made this page to show on a direct way: </p>
<ul>
    <li>who I am</li>
    <li>which projects I have done so far</li>
    <li> ... and that I am familiar with frontend basics, since I have created everything you can see myself</li>
</ul>

    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> My road to coding</h2>
   
    <p class="road">&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved to Austria in 2019 so that we could give our son, who was 2 years old at the time, a future in a truly democratic country, even if we both had to give up our careers for it . I was able to spend 4 wonderful years with him at home, and because the recognition process was too long and not affordable for us, I actively researched what other directions I could orient myself professionally.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;My advisor suggested the Java developer course at everyone codes, that would allow me to get started in the world of codes. I read myself into the topic and found the idea of â€‹being able to use my analytical thinking - albeit a little differently, but still - fascinating.
        I successfully passed the admissions process and after a year on this course, after thousands of lines of code and sometimes 16 hours of coding a day, I can only say: thank you to everyone who made it possible for me to make a fresh start!
        <br>
        I love it, I'm at the beginning of my path, but I'm passionate about it!

    <h2><i class="fa-brands fa-golang"></i> My goal</h2>
    <p> It's very simple: To be a better Java developer tomorrow than I was yesterday or today.
        I always want to deepen my knowledge and experience everything the world of code can offer me.</p>

        } <br>
